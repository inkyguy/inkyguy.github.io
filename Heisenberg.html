    <h1>Heisenberg Uncertainty</h1><br><br>

      Heisenberg Uncertainty principle: 
      <br>

For ages, scientists have been looking at things and drawing certain laws, conclusions, and rules, etc.<br>
but how we look?? Yeah, obviously with eyes, but scientifically speaking our eyes collect the light rays which get reflected from the object and utilize those reflected rays to make an image inside our brain.

<br><br>
*Point is,  light (speaking of the visible spectrum of light observable by the human eye) is just electromagnetic radiation which consists of photons, and has a certain wavelength and frequency.
<br><br>
but sadly this only applies to particles that are certainly larger enough to reflect light(visible).
<br>
when we try to zoom much more into things, we cant look beyond a certain point clearly with our naked eye.<br><br>
At a certain period, scientists wanted to look closer and closer and closer into an object and at last, they ended up at something called an atom,
      they tried the same zooming into every possible things aroung, they ended up at same thing, which is an atom.<br><br>
  whatever object you zoom at, the last thing you'll end up is "Atom"(this is what everything in the universe is made up of, building blocks of everything) we need electron microscope (shoot electrons at it instead of photons) to view(create an image) atoms, as visible light waves have a wavelength of 400-700 nanometers, but atoms are roughly 0.2 nanometers, if we tried using an optical microscope(visible light) this visible light might not hit the atoms, they just escape through the gap. 
<br><Br>
It's like trying to hit a very teeny-tiny target with large objects, where that tiny object can easily escape through the gaps in a large object.

<br><br>
hence to observe we need different spectrum light other than visible spectrum, radiation(light) with high frequency and less wavelength hence HIGH ENERGY. hence to observe very very small particles we use high energy lights, and in turn, we disturb, create uncertainty in the state of that tiny particle through high energy light to view them, this is called Heisenberg's uncertainty, if you view them, its velocity is uncertain due to high energy beam hits it.  

<br>
That's why quantum bits, which are very small than atoms when viewed they collapse from their original state.
